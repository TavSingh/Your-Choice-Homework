## Overview

This simple program simulates some students and their favorite class. It uses two lists to store student names and class names, then assigns each student a random class. The results are stored in a HashMap, where the key is the student's name and the value is their randomly assigned favorite class. The program then prints out each student's name and thier favorite class.

## How It Works

- The program defines a list of students and a list of subjects.
- Using a random number generator, the program assigns a random subject from the list to each student.
- The assignment is stored in a HashMap where the student's name is the key and the favorite class is the value.
- The program then iterates through the HashMap and prints each studentâ€™s favorite class.

## Topics Chosen

This program covers two Java topics I wanted to refresh my memory on:

- **Lists**:  
   The program uses ArrayList to store the list of student names and available subjects. Lists allow us to maintain an ordered collection of items and to access or manipulate them via index.

- **Maps**:  
   The program uses HashMap to store the relationship between students and their favorite classes. Maps are used for storing key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and we can quickly retrieve or modify values based on their key.
